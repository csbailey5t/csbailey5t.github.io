I'm a developer and teacher, currently the Digital Research and Scholarship Librarian at the [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/). After discovering a love of code, application building, and computational research, I shifted away from my Ph.D. program in philosophical theology at the University of Virginia to become a Digital Humanities Developer at the beloved [Scholars' Lab](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia.

Since then, I've been a Research Developer in the [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR)](https://cidr.stanford.edu) at [Stanford Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/), where I collaborated with humanities and social science faculty to build digital scholarship projects, created and taught digital research methods workshops, and contributed to open source projects. I was also the Head of [Social Science Data and Software (SSDS)](https://ssds.stanford.edu/) at Stanford Libraries, where I oversaw a group of Ph.D. students in delivering expert consultation on statistical computing, organized and taught in the CIDR workshop series, and collaborated with colleagues across Stanford University to provide better access to data and support for data-driven research.

As a developer, I try to share my own joy in writing code, working with data, and moving projects along bit-by-bit. As a teacher, I love to help people discover and learn to code, and try to break down the social and technical barriers that many people face when learning to do technical work.
