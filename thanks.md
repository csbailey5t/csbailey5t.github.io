I've had a lot of mentors in the digital humanities and libraries worlds. I can't image being where I am without my time in the [Scholars' Lab](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/) or [CIDR](https://cidr.stanford.ed). I think about libraries and scholarly activity the way I do because of my colleagues from both places, who pushed me to think philosophically about the whys and hows of our work as scholars and librarians (even if we don't have library degrees).

To call out some individuals, though, I wouldn't be here without:

- Bethany Nowviskie
- Wayne Graham
- Eric Rochester
- Stu Snydman
- Glen Worthey
